# Hi, I'm Alex :)

I'm mainly a Python Freelance Software Developer focused on creating bugs and then squashing 'em :)

My primary focuses are `consultancy`, `automation`, `vulnerability assessment` with the help of `python`, `laravel`, `c#` and `linux`, with a salt of `docker` here and there if needed.
