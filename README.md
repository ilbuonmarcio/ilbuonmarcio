# Hi, I'm Alex :)

I'm mainly a Software Developer focused on creating bugs and then squashing 'em :)

My primary focuses are `automation`, `python`, `laravel`, `c#` and `linux`, with a salt of `docker` here and there if needed.

Right now I'm working as a self-employed freelance software developer, so if you have a project in mind feel free to get in touch!

If you need consultancy, alessandro@goldmark.solutions is a good place to write!

Stay safe! ðŸ’™
