# Hi, I'm @ilbuonmarcio, a turtle person 🐢

![im dumb](https://blog.ilbuonmarcio.dev/res/img/profilepic.png)

I'm a ~professional~ developer 👨‍💻, Linux enthusiast 🐧 and Python evangelist 🐍.

I like reading books 📚, psychology 🧠, everything tech 💾 and breathing 🍃. Especially the last one!

Recently I started working more and more on myself to better understand what I'm really capable of doing with my potential, and it seems to work so I'm happy with the results :)
