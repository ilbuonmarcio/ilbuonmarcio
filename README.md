# Hi, I'm Alex :)

Summary of me personally:
- A turtle over a rabbit
- CentOS over Debian
- ArchLinux over Manjaro over Ubuntu
- Linux over Windows over macOS
- Software Development over System Administrator Engineering & DevOps
- Python over PHP
- PostgreSQL over MySQL
- Docker over being silly and dumb and waste time better spent off other things
- Simple over complex
- Complex over complicated
- Less over more, less is more

For business related stuff or for catching up with me, alessandro.marchioro1998@gmail.com is a good place to write!
